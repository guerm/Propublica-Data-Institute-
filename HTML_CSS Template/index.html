    <p class="rilke"> <span class= "move"> "Just slap anything on when you see a blank canvas staring you in the face like some imbecile. <span class="try"> You don't know how paralyzing that is, that stare of a blank canvas, which says to the painter 'you can't do anything.'</span> 
    
        The canvas has an idiotic stare and mesmerises some painters so much that they turn into idiots themselves. Many painters are afraid in front of the blank canvas. But the blank canvas is afraid of the real, passionate painter who dares and who has broken the spell of 'you can't' once and for all." </span> </p>

    <p class="vonnegut"> "The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or how badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake. Sing in the shower. Dance to the radio. Tell stories. Write a poem to a friend, even a lousy poem. Do it as well as you possibly can. You will get an enormous reward: <span class="try">You will have created something. </span>" </p>

    <p class="rilke">"You are looking outside, and that is what you should most avoid right now. No one can advise or help you-no one. There is only one thing you should do. Go into yourself. ind out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart, <span class="try">confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write.</span>This most of all: ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write?" </p>

    <p class="vonnegut"> "Characteristic feature of the authoritariansm on our society is its insidious ability to addict people to the endless pursuit of external rewards, wealth, prestige, position, promotion, approval of one's lifestyle by others, ceremonial honors, and status symbols of all kinds. To successfully pursue these goals, they have to learn elaborate rules of etiquette and familiarize themselves with customes, traditions, protocols and so on. The youth of today must unlearn this sel-defeating way of life. <span class="try">The culture of working only for material possessions and rewards must be discarded. </span> Are you aware of your signals? Do you trust them? Have you taken control over your life into your own hands? Take this from me, the more decisions you can make avoiding external pressures, whivh will constantly try to manipulate you, the better your life will be, the better your society will become. Life is a difficult game. You can win only by retaining your birthright to be a person. And to retain this right, you will have to be willing to take the social or external risks involved in ignoring pressures to do things the way others say they should be done." </p>
